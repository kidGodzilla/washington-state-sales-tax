# Washington State Sales Tax Calculation library

## washington-state-sales-tax on NPM

This is a very simple library to calculate sales tax rates for Washington State, in the United States. It doesn't do anything else.

Useful if your only nexus is in Washington state (like me). I take no responsibility for your use of this library (see license). API is unofficially modeled after TaxJar (no affiliation, this is what I was replacing).

**Tax Rates valid for Jan 01 2019 to Mar 31 2019.**

## How it works

### Named tax rates by city
If a named tax rate is provided by Washington State via https://dor.wa.gov/get-form-or-publication/publications-subject/local-sales-use-tax-rates-excel-format, this rate is returned. See the example below.


### County lookup via Mapquest Open APIs
If a rate for a city is not explicitly provided, it is charged the county unincorporated rate. 

To determine this, we need to first determine which county a city is in. 

For this, we are using the Mapquest Open API.  https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/open/

This now requires registration via https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/


### Inferred tax rate
If you choose not to use the Mapquest API or it returns an error, and the city rate is not explicity provided in the dataset above, a rate of 10.1% is charged, and the result will include the key/value `inferred = true`. It is up to you how you wish to implement this and you take responsibility for how you handle this fallback case (for example, you may refund this manually or set up a system to alert your customer in case this occurs).


## Installation

`npm i -s washington-state-sales-tax`

## Usage

Require: `const { taxForOrder } = require('washington-state-sales-tax');`

The function `taxForOrder` takes two arguments, a parameters object, which should have two keys: `amount` and `zip`. The second argument is a callback function, with one argument, a resulting output object.

```
taxForOrder({
    amount: 100,
    zip: 98101
}, function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

### Expected output

```
{
  "amount": 100,
  "shipping": 0,
  "order_total_amount": 100,
  "zip": "98101",
  "latitude": 47.6114,
  "longitude": -122.3305,
  "city": "Seattle",
  "state": "WA",
  "country": "US",
  "tax_source": "destination",
  "taxable_amount": 100,
  "freight_taxable": true,
  "has_nexus": true,
  "county": "King",
  "locationCode": 1726,
  "localTaxRate": 0.036,
  "stateTaxRate": 0.065,
  "totalTaxRate": 0.101,
  "taxLocaleString": "Seattle",
  "jurisdictions": {
    "country": "US",
    "state": "WA",
    "county": "KING",
    "city": "SEATTLE"
  },
  "rate": 0.101,
  "inferred": false,
  "amount_to_collect": 10.1
}
```

## Example: An out-of-state zip code is provided

```
// 10001 Manhattan, New York City, NY â€“ Out of state (no tax collected)
taxForOrder({
    amount: 100,
    zip: 10001
}, function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

### Result

```
{
  "amount": 100,
  "shipping": 0,
  "order_total_amount": 100,
  "zip": "10001",
  "latitude": 40.7484,
  "longitude": -73.9967,
  "city": "New York",
  "state": "NY",
  "country": "US",
  "freight_taxable": true,
  "amount_to_collect": 0,
  "taxable_amount": 0,
  "has_nexus": false,
  "rate": 0
}
```

## Example: Tax applicable but rate is not determined, and an inferred tax rate is used

```
// Outlook, WA 98938 - Yakima County Unincorp. Areas - Inferred tax rate
taxForOrder({
    amount: 100,
    zip: 98938
}, function (data) {
    console.log(data);
});
```

### Result

```
{
  "amount": 100,
  "shipping": 0,
  "order_total_amount": 100,
  "zip": "98938",
  "latitude": 46.3525,
  "longitude": -120.097,
  "city": "Outlook",
  "state": "WA",
  "country": "US",
  "tax_source": "destination",
  "taxable_amount": 100,
  "freight_taxable": true,
  "has_nexus": true,
  "jurisdictions": {
    "country": "US",
    "state": "WA",
    "city": "OUTLOOK"
  },
  "inferredRate": 0.101,
  "inferred": true,
  "rate": 0.101,
  "amount_to_collect": 10.1
}
```
